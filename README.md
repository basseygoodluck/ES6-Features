# ES6-Features

This README provides a summary of key JavaScript concepts, including classes, array functions, variable declarations, array methods, and destructuring.
Classes

Classes are blueprints for creating objects in JavaScript, allowing developers to define properties and methods that the objects will inherit. They support features such as inheritance, where one class can extend another, promoting code reusability and organization.

Array Functions

Array functions are methods that allow manipulation and operations on arrays. Common array functions include:
- forEach: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
- map: Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element of the original array.
- filter: Creates a new array containing elements that pass a specified test implemented by a provided function.
- reduce: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array to produce a single output value.
- find: Returns the first element in the array that satisfies a provided testing function.

Variables

JavaScript uses three keywords for declaring variables:
- var: Function-scoped or globally-scoped, allowing re-declaration and updating.
- let: Block-scoped, permitting updates but not re-declarations within the same block.
- const: Block-scoped, disallowing updates or re-declarations after initialization; it must be initialized at the time of declaration.

Array Methods

JavaScript provides several built-in methods to work with arrays, including:
- .map(): Transforms each element of an array according to a specified function, returning a new array.
- .filter(): Creates a new array with elements that meet a certain condition defined by a specified function.
- .reduce(): Accumulates a single value by executing a specified function on each element of the array.
- .forEach(): Iterates over each element in the array, executing a specified function for each.

Destructuring

Destructuring is a syntax feature that allows the unpacking of values from arrays or properties from objects into separate variables. This practice improves code readability and conciseness by allowing multiple variable assignments in a single statement.
